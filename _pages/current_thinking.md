To give you a flavor of the work that I do, I highlight a few of my ongoing workstreams here. 

## Consolidation and Health Equity
Across healthcare markets, consolidation has rapidly accelerated in recent years. Some of my ongoing work thinks about how consolidation may impact patient populations differently depending on their payer status and race/ethnicity. Beyond just studying the impacts of mergers and acquisitions, I also think quite a bit about which legal frameworks and policies may be best suited for evaluating and intervening when entities may consolidate.

## Medical Debt and Changes in Markets and Policies
Medical debt is a critical challenge in the US healthcare system. I think about how hospital market structure may enable behaviors that yield consumer medical debt. I also think about how policies like surprise billing laws may or may not provide a mechanism by which patients may be protected from the accrual of such debts.

## Methods in Health Equity Research
Alongside Arjee Restar (University of Washington) and other co-authors, I'm thinking about how to navigate data conceptualization, collection, and measurement for an exciting new textbook. I also am considering how to help other folks navigate the use of difference-in-differences analyses for health equity research.
