My name is Alexander Adia, and I am a third year doctoral student in Health Policy (Population and Data Science Track) at the University of California, Berkeley. 

I think about how inequities in access and quality of health services are dynamically shaped by changes in organizational practices, markets, and policies. I like to draw my theoretical perspectives from the social sciences and use methods drawn from health policy, computational social science, and economics. My ongoing work is mostly centered around a) hospital consolidation and equity of care and b) medical debt and changes in market structure and policies. 

In my pre-doctoral life, I thought a lot about HIV in the Philippines, data disaggregation for Asians in the US, and health among the FilAm community. While I do not focus on these topics anymore, I draw from these experiences in my current work and am always happy to talk to those interested in these topics.

You can contact me about my research, applying to health policy doctoral programs, or just to chat at a dot adia at berkeley dot edu.
