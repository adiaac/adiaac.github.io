My name is Alexander Adia, and I am a third year doctoral student in Health Policy (Population and Data Science Track) at the University of California, Berkeley. 

I study how health and social policies shape inequities in health outcomes. In particular, I consider how policies intersect with laws, markets, and organizational practices to produce these outcomes. I like to draw my theoretical perspectives from the social sciences and use methods drawn from health policy, computational social science, and economics. My ongoing work is mostly centered around a) hospital consolidation and equity of care and b) medical debt and changes in market structure and policies. 

In my pre-doctoral life, I thought a lot about HIV in the Philippines, data disaggregation for Asians in the US, and health among the FilAm community. While I no longer focus on these topics, I draw from these experiences in my current work and am always happy to talk to those who are working on these issues.
