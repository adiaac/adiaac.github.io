I am a third year doctoral student in Health Policy (Population and Data Science Track) at the University of California, Berkeley. My research examines how market factors and policies shape access and quality in health services, especially in the context of health equity and addressing health disparities.

To achieve this, I draw from theoretical perspectives from the social sciences and leverage methods from health policy, computational social science, and economics. My current work focuses on medical debt, provider market consolidation and its impacts on patients, and quality of care for Medicaid patients.
